# Odbijanka---Pong-Game-PL
Old java student project.

Game written in 2022. I know that polish names of variables are reprehensible but I was young and dumb.
Polish comments was required.

Typical Pong Game but with dingy graphics.
Start game: SPACE
Player 1: W- UP, S - DOWN
Player 2: Arrows UP and DOWN

Game ends after 5 points and shows winner on screen - points rechangable in code (not in game) - only for testing.
Ball is speeding up after bounce off the Player.
